# game-gear-power-docs
This repo is my attempt at understanding and documenting the Game
Gear's power circuitry. I don't know how accurate it is, and I welcome
any input. Ideally this becomes the definitive document for this
topic, as I haven't found any others.

While you could compile the LaTeX (ideally with LuaLaTeX), it's easier
to just get the PDF from the releases.
